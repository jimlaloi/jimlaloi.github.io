title: About me
---

Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the [Department of French and Italian](https://fi.byu.edu) and an affiliate of the [Department of Linguistics](https://ling.byu.edu/) at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu), where I've been since 2020. I received my Ph.D in French Linguistics from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).

I'm a cognitive linguist interested primarily in semantic change. In my research, I use digital corpora to investigate changes in linguistic meaning, with an aim towards identifying regularities that can inform our understanding of the mind. I use a variety of functionalist approaches in my work, especially Frame Semantics.
