This weekend I am presenting at the online conference [7th International Conference on Grammar and Text](https://clunl.fcsh.unl.pt/en/eventos-cientificos/grato/grato-2021/). The conference is hosted in Lisbon, although I will unfortunately only be presenting online. The title of my talk is "Text genre and participant role alternations in the French Spending frame." I will be discussing the important role that genre plays in affecting the use of participant role alternations in some of the data from my dissertation.
