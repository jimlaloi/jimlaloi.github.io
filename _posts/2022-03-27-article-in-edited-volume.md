The volume *Directions for Pedagogical Construction Grammar: Learning and Teaching (with) Constructions* edited by Hans Boas has just been published. The book includes my article "Frame-based metonymy in teaching L2 vocabulary". In this article, I provide a practical example of adapting a traditional approach to teaching verbs (based around inflectional sets) to a construction-based approach organized around semantic frames. Along the way, I discuss how teaching in this way can help students to integrate figurative devices such as metonymy, which is ubiquitous in natural language, into their L2 production. This work represents a first step towards practical application of my research on metonymy in semantic frames, which I've explored in my dissertation and elsewhere. You can check out the full volume over on [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Directions_for_Pedagogical_Construction/SOxcEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Directions-Pedagogical-Construction-Grammar-Constructions/dp/3110746646/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36FDSPUPBCPOE&keywords=Directions+for+Pedagogical+Construction+Grammar+Learning+and+Teaching+%28with%29+Constructions&qid=1652460994&sprefix=directions+for+pedagogical+construction+grammar+learning+and+teaching+with+constructions%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-1).
