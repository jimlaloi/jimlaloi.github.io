I presented this week at the 53rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages. Typically this conference is held somewhere in North America, but this year it was in Paris, so I made it a real priority to go! I presented with my colleague Adam McBride on allophonic variation in Poitevin-Saintongeais, an endangered minority Gallo-Romance language of western France.
