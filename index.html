        Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://fi.byu.edu" target="_blank">French</a> <a href="https://ling.byu.edu/" target="_blank">Linguistics</a> at <a href="https://www.byu.edu" target="_blank">Brigham Young University</a>, where I've been since 2020. I received my Ph.D from the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">University of Texas at Austin</a>.

        I'm a cognitive linguist interested primarily in semantic change. In my research, I use digital corpora to investigate changes in linguistic meaning, with an aim towards identifying regularities that can inform our understanding of the mind. I use a variety of functionalist approaches in my work, especially Frame Semantics.
