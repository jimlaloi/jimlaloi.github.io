## Materials

### *Grammaire Ouverte*

I am the creator of [grammaireouverte.org](https://www.grammaireouverte.org/), an open educational resource for advanced French grammar. I began development of the site in 2021 by translating into French another open educational resource, [Tex's French Grammar](https://www.laits.utexas.edu/tex/), which is intended as an introductory pedagogical grammar. I supplemented this material by writing more detailed and advanced explanations of certain grammar concepts, replacing examples with authentic sentences from the [Corpus de référence du français contemporain](https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2016/05/shsconf_cmlf2016_11002/shsconf_cmlf2016_11002.html), and inserting notes on dialectal and register variation. Development is ongoing, with additional features planned for the future.
