I"<p>I’m about to start my first year teaching at BYU! It has been an odd year — the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US right before I defended my dissertation. I ended up defending in my slippers at home in Alabama, miles away from my committee at the University of Texas. Now I’m in Provo figuring out how I’m going to teach when half my students are masked and socially distanced in the classroom and the other half are watching from home. Still, I’m so grateful to be back at my alma mater, teaching the subjects I love!</p>
