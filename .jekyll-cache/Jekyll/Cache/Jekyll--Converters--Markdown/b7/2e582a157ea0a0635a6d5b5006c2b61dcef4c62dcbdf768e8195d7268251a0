<p>I‚Äôm a cognitive and historical linguist interested in what we can learn about the mind by observing changes in linguistic meaning. Below are some descriptions of research projects I‚Äôve been involved in. For publication details, please see my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-change-in-body-part-terms">Semantic change in body-part terms</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs notoriously difficult to identify patterns in lexical semantic change. One domain where there has been some progress is words for parts of the human body. Prior researchers have found that new words for body parts tend to come from particular sources. However, a close look at data on this subject in the Romance languages (especially within the <a href="http://www.decolar.uni-tuebingen.de/">DECOLAR database</a>) shows a surprising number of exceptions to these patterns. I explore why these exceptions occur and how we can revise our understanding of universal trends in semantic change.</p>

<h3 id="metonymic-argument-alternations">Metonymic argument alternations</h3>

<p>Linguistic constructions have slots that are filled with particular semantic roles. In some constructions, a few different roles can fill the same slot, such as ‚ÄúThe mayor denied the allegations‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe press release denied the allegations‚Äù. Alternations like these are examples of <em>metonymy</em>, where one item stands for another that it‚Äôs closely related to. I look for instances of these metonymic argument alternations in historical data to see how the use of particular metonymies has changed over time. Metonymy is a fundamental mechanism in cognition and language, so observing how its usage varies over time may help us to better understand how cultural and linguistic associations that we take for granted have developed.</p>

<h3 id="nasal-vowel-misspellings">Nasal vowel misspellings</h3>

<p>The French nasal vowels have shifted over time to the point that the way they‚Äôre spelled is not very reflective of how most people actually pronounce them, especially in certain dialects. In formal writing, the force of spelling standards is stronger than any phonological influence. But on Twitter, where people pay less attention to accidental misspellings and feel more free to use creative spellings intentionally, nonstandard spellings of nasal vowels appear that more closely match modern pronunciation. I collected nonstandard spellings of nasal vowels from Twitter to see which words receive shifted spellings most often and why.</p>
