I"×<p>The course I teach most often is Advanced French Part 1 (French 321). This is an important course in my department, because it is usually the first course taken by new students who learned French as missionaries. For many of those who go on to major or minor in French in my department, French 321 is where they first started considering their course of study. I work hard to improve this course every semester to make a good first impression with these students.</p>
