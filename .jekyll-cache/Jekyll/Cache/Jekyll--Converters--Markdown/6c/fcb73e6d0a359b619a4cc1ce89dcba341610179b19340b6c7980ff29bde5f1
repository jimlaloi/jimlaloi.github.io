I"ˆ	<p>The volume <em>Directions for Pedagogical Construction Grammar: Learning and Teaching (with) Constructions</em> edited by Hans Boas has just been published. The book includes my article ‚ÄúFrame-based metonymy in teaching L2 vocabulary‚Äù. In this article, I provide a practical example of adapting a traditional approach to teaching verbs (based around inflectional sets) to a construction-based approach organized around semantic frames. Along the way, I discuss how teaching in this way can help students to integrate figurative devices such as metonymy, which is ubiquitous in natural language, into their L2 production. This work represents a first step towards practical application of my research on metonymy in semantic frames.

<p>My article ‚ÄúMetonymy and argument alternations in French communication frames‚Äù has just been published in the journal <em>Cognitive Linguistics</em>. This article expands on work from my dissertation. I investigated French words that express communication, particularly those dealing with revealing a secret (i.e. <em>r√©v√©ler</em> ‚Äòreveal‚Äô, <em>divulguer</em> ‚Äòdivulge‚Äô, <em>d√©voilement</em> ‚Äòunveiling‚Äô, etc.). Around these words, the semantic arguments can alternate ‚Äî for example, you can say that a Speaker revealed a secret (<em>Jean r√©v√®le‚Ä¶</em>) or that a Medium of communication revealed a secret (<em>Le livre r√©v√®le‚Ä¶</em>). These alternations are examples of metonymy, a mental mechanism that allows linked concepts to stand for one another. I looked at alternations like this historically, finding that certain alternations became more frequent in written French over the past few centuries. The analysis shows connections between sociohistorical changes (such as the rise of print media in Europe) and lexico-constructional changes in the language.
