I"+<p>This weekend I am presenting at the online conference <a href="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/englishhistorycreativewriting/research/lxgr/?tab=lxgr-archive">Corpus Approaches to LexicoGrammar</a>. The title of my talk is “A lexicogrammatical approach to participant role alternations in the French Spending frame.” I will be drawing from data collected for my dissertation to discuss the interface between syntax and the lexicon.
