I"<p>My article â€œMetonymy and argument alternations in French communication framesâ€ has just been published in the journal <em>Cognitive Linguistics</em>. This article expands on work from my dissertation. I investigated French words that express communication, particularly those dealing with revealing a secret (i.e. <em>rÃ©vÃ©ler</em> â€˜revealâ€™, <em>divulguer</em> â€˜divulgeâ€™, <em>dÃ©voilement</em> â€˜unveilingâ€™, etc.). Around these words, the semantic arguments can alternate â€” for example, you can say that a Speaker revealed a secret (<em>Jean rÃ©vÃ¨leâ€¦</em>) or that a Medium of communication revealed a secret (<em>Le livre rÃ©vÃ¨leâ€¦</em>).</p>
