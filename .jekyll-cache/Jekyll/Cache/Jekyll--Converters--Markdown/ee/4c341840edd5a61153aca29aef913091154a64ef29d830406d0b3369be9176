I"`<p>The volume <em>Directions for Pedagogical Construction Grammar: Learning and Teaching (with) Constructions</em> edited by Hans Boas has just been published. The book includes my article “Frame-based metonymy in teaching L2 vocabulary”. In this article, I provide a practical example of adapting a traditional approach to teaching verbs (based around inflectional sets) to a construction-based approach organized around semantic frames. Along the way, I discuss how teaching in this way can help students to integrate figurative devices such as metonymy, which is ubiquitous in natural language, into their L2 production. This work represents a first step towards practical application of my research on metonymy in semantic frames, which I’ve explored in my dissertation and elsewhere.
