<p>I’m a cognitive and historical linguist interested in what we can learn about the mind by observing changes in linguistic meaning. Below are some descriptions of research projects I’ve been involved in. For publication details, please see my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-change-in-body-part-terms">Semantic change in body-part terms</h3>

<p>It’s notoriously difficult to identify patterns in lexical semantic change. One domain where there has been some progress is words for parts of the human body. Prior researchers have found that new words for body parts tend to come from particular sources. However, a close look at data on this subject in the Romance languages (especially within the <a href="http://www.decolar.uni-tuebingen.de/">DECOLAR database</a>) shows a surprising number of exceptions to these patterns. I explore why these exceptions occur and how we can revise our understanding of universal trends in semantic change.</p>
