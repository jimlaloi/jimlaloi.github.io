I"œ<p>This weekend I am presenting at the online conference <a href="https://clunl.fcsh.unl.pt/en/eventos-cientificos/grato/grato-2021/">7th International Conference on Grammar and Text</a>. The conference is hosted in Lisbon, although I will unfortunately only be presenting online. The title of my talk is â€œText genre and participant role alternations in the French Spending frame.â€ I will be discussing the important role that genre plays in affecting the use of participant role alternations in some of the data from my dissertation.
